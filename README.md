# Ball-Brick Game



## Description

Based on the pdf provided, this mini-game was constructed with nested lists in python3. 
The same logic can be implemented in c++ but python3 seemed simpler. 
All levels from 1-5 works perfectly and was stress-tested for **odd number sizes of NxN matrix only**. (Even number would make it asymetric and weird-looking, which we wouldn't want in a game.)

## Note
There could be few bugs around the code, mostly in the RD and LD chain of code which will be the fixed and pushed as and when it is found around the deadline time.
While building this standalone application, I did not pay much attention to the time complexity of the code(it is n^3 I believe)
