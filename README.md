# :video_game: Ball-Brick Game

- The mini-game was constructed using Python3. (I chose Python3 over c++ for simplicity)
- All levels from 1-5 works perfectly and was stress-tested for **odd number sizes of NxN matrix only**. (Even number would make it asymmetric and weird-looking, which we wouldn't want in a game.)

## :game_die: Note:
- Running the program is simple, just run the "ball_brick.py" with the python3 Interpreter.
- Time complexity - n^3 (can be optimized)
- Tested for N = 7/9 or any odd number
